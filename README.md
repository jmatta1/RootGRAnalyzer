RootGRAnalyzer
==============

A GUI package for root for analysis of giant resonance data from the RCNP which has been run through the ntuples analyzer and converted to root trees from hbook format.

If you use this code for analysis, credit must be given to J.T. Matta and University of Notre Dame in any publications that result.

This code is quite old and somewhat embarrassing in its quality, if you are still using it, I apologize for how difficult it must be to edit and use.
